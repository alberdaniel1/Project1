 Recipe Picker helps you find recipes based on ingredients or dishes you have in mind, utilizing a cominbation of HTML, CSS, and Jscript.
  
## Getting Recipes 
  Via user input, we call a recipe API from API Ninja and display them to you. After clicking on one of the recipes, a suppliemtnal youtube video will appear. Hopefully the combination of the written recipe and video will assist you in cooking a great meal, or getting inspiration for your own recipe.
